# Online Magazine

The mission: create an online news/magazine site that has a header, a main news article/feature and a grid of news/articles. 
Goal: responsive design i.e Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.

## The problem
Drew a scetch of what I wanted the site to look like: clean and somewhat curious. 
Identified it's components, looked for relevant html tags and started designing in css. Used Flexbox.
The problem was to make it responsive, defining parent containers and make it work.
Had to start over from the first design as I had no struture in the corrections I made to the faulty design (images not behaving as wanted, cards not looking as wanted...). Had a brief encounter with grid, realised time was too scarce, stayed with flex-box only. Opted for flip-cards for the interactivity. 
If I had more time I would arrange the header ever so slightly. Tweek the color scheme of the site. Place product pictures on the flip-side of the cards, and the read-me button would actually link to an article. I would also fix the following issues: 1- the Tiger image enlarging before shrinking, going from desktop to tablet. 
and 2- the nav bar displaying although set to display: none.
